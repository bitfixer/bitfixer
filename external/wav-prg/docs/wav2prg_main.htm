<Title>Creating emulator files from Commodore 64 tapes</Title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
When you want to create emulator files, this window is shown.
<p>
<img src="wav2prg.png" alt="WAV2PRG window">
<p>
<b>Plug-in directory</b>: this is the directory where plug-ins are. A WAV-PRG
plug-in is a .dll file which allows WAV-PRG to support one or more loaders. The
default is the subdirectory <i>loaders</i> of the current
directory. If the plug-in you want to use is somewhere else, click on <i>Change</i> and choose another
directory<br>
<b>Use loader</b>: this allows to choose a loader among the ones supported by the installed plug-ins.
If you choose "Default C64" or "Default C16" (as appropriate for the tape, note
that "Default C64" is also appropriate for Vic20), an attempt will be made to
auto-detect the formats used in the rest of the tape. Otherwise, choose the loader
used in the tape you want to convert (if known, and if supported).<br>
<b>Advanced</b>: only recommended for advanced users. In general, a higher number
makes the program more tolerant, so it will tend not to stop when it finds suspicious pulses.<br>
<b>Origin</b>: check <i>File</i> if the input is a WAV or TAP file. Check <i>Sound card</i> if the input comes
from the sound card input, which is connected to the output of a tape player. The <i>Sound
card</i> button is disabled if any of the files <i>tapencoder.dll</i> and <i>libportaudio-2.dll</i>
are not present in the same directory as the main executable (<i>wavprg.exe</i>).
Those files are distributed with Audiotap.
<br>
<b>Advanced options</b>: these will be ignored if the input is  a TAP file.<br>
<b>Inverted waveform</b>: some sound cards invert the signal, that is they turn negative values of the
waveform into positive ones and vice versa. If the input is such a sound card, or a .WAV
file generated with such a sound card, invalid data will come from the tape and no programs
will be converted. In these cases, check this box. In general, if you get the message
"0 programs converted", try toggling this box and start again.<br>
<b>Input frequency</b>: Frequency of sound coming from sound card. As long as the frequency
is supported by the sound card, the higher, the better. 44100 Hz is the default,
because it is almost universally supported. Yet, many modern sound cards support 96000 Hz: if yours does,
it is recommended to use that. This parameter is ignored if the input is an
audio file: in those cases, frequency will be taken form the file itself.<br>
<b>Sensitivity</b>: with sensitivity 0, maximums and minimums are ignored in case they
come before the trigger has fired. There can be cases, however, in which such maximums and minimums
have to be considered. If the sensitivity is > 0 but low, maximums a little below the trigger level
and minimums a little above the trigger lever will be considered as well. As the sensitivity increases,
more maximums and minimums will be considered. If the sensitivity is 100, all maximums and minimums
will be considered. It is only recommended to use high values of sensitivity with bad tapes, in
presence of sudden sound level changes, otherwise better keep this low.<br>
<b>Use clock</b>: Different models have different clock frequencies. Duration of a pulse in samples
is converted to duration in clock cycles. This affect the conversion factor between the two units.<br>
<b>Destination</b>: choose whether to create a cleaned TAP file, multiple .PRG,
multiple .P00 or a single .T64 file, or not to create any files (useful if you
just want to analyse the contents without saving them).<br>
<b>Include broken and incomplete files</b>: if a file has a load error, or if the tape ends before a file
has been fully extracted, by default the file will not be saved. Check this box in order to save those files
too<br>
<b>Include all slow-loading files</b>: when choosing "Default C64" or "Default C16",
slow non-turbo files will be detected. If the tape uses a turbo loader, those files
will typically contain the loader code and little else, so those are filtered out
by default. By checking this box, those files will be saved as well.<br>
<b>Folder for PRG/P00</b>: if you choose to create .PRG or .P00 files, they will be saved
in this directory. Click on <i>Change</i> to choose the directory.<br> If you
choose <i>Clean TAP</i>, <i>T64</i> or <i>Test only</i> as destination, this will be ignored.<br>
