<Title>Creating Commodore 64 tapes from emulator files</Title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
WAV-PRG is able to read emulator files (.PRG, .P00, .T64) and convert them to:
<ul>
<li>a .TAP file
<li>a .WAV file, which can be later played and recorded to a tape
<li>a sound, which is played right away from the sound card. If a normal tape recorder's input is connected to the sound card's output, a tape can be directly recorded.
</ul>
In order to perform the latter two, some additional files are required: <i>tapdecoder.dll</i> (for both), <i>libaudiofile-1.dll</i> (for the second one only), <i>libportaudio-2.dll</i> (for the third one only). Those files are not distributed with WAV-PRG. They are distributed with Audiotap. Download Audiotap and put the above files in the same directory where the file wavprg.exe is.
