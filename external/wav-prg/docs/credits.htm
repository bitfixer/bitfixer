WAV-PRG is copyright &copy; 1998-2008 Fabrizio Gennari. It is distributed under the

<p>
Credits go to these people:
<ul>
<li><b>Fabrizio Gennari</b>: wrote the original (publicly unreleased) implementation in Turbo Pascal in late
1997. Wrote version 1.0, released in November 1998, and has maintained the project since then
<li><b>Janne Veli Kujala</b>: wrote a modified version, based on version 1.0 for Linux, which introduced a lot
of new ideas. Although most of his code is gone now, some ideas, such as direct conversion from sound card
and notification of possibly wrong pulses, are still here
<li><b>Ingo Rullhusen</b>: wrote the part which creates C16/Plus4 tapes. The Turbo Tape 64-compatible
loader for C16/Plus4 is modified from the one in Andreas Jung's Tape Tools (TTLOAD/TTSAVE). Also, he
gave suggestion on how to improve C16/Plus4 support overall
<li><b>Per H&aring;kan Sundell</b>: invented the TAP format, and wrote a
<a href="http://www.computerbrains.com/tapformat.html">description</a> of it
<li><b>Luigi Di Fraia</b>: a lot of exchange of ideas about the optimal waveform for conversion to tape
<li><b>Wolfgang Lorenz</b>: wrote the algorithm for reducing the name of a P00 file to 8 characters, which
was cut'n'pasted (with some modifications to make it compile with a C compiler rather than a C++ one) into
the source code
<li><b>the VICE team</b>: some code for the Windows version of this excellent free GPL'ed Commodore 64 emulator
was the source of inspiration for some aspects of the graphical user interface (especially the T64 entry
selection)
<li><b>Richard Storer, Ben Castricum and Tomaz Kac</b>: documented the Commodore kernel loader: useful for
improving the creation of tapes and writing the relevant plug-ins for the conversion from tapes
<li><b>Peter Schepers</b>: wrote <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~schepers/formats.html">an excellent document</a>
about the format of Commodore 64 emulator files
</ul>
...and all the people who, in these years, have given suggestions for new features and bug fixes
