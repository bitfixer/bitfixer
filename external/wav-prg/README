WAV-PRG is a program which tries to extract binary data from Commodore tapes,
and converts binary data into Commodore tapes.

It uses the Audiotap library to access Commodore tapes (the Audiotap library
can read TAP, DMP and some kinds of audio files including WAV, and can write
TAP and WAV files).

In order to build it, GNU make and a compiler are needed. Unix systems
typically have such an environment ready, while, on Windows, MinGW
(http://www.mingw.org/) will do. To build, type "make" followed by the target
name (not needed for the default target) and the optional modifiers.

The possible targets are:
* wavprg.exe (the default target), the Windows GUI executable
* wav2prg.exe, the Windows command-line tape extractor
* prg2wav.exe, the Windows command-line tape creator
* cmdline/wav2prg, the Unix command-line tape extractor
* cmdline/prg2wav, the Unix command-line tape creator

The dependency on the Audiotap library means that:
1. at compile time, the compiler must be able to find audiotap.h
2. at link time, the linker must be able to find audiotap.lib (Windows)
   libaudiotap.so (Unix)
3. at run time, the executable must be able to find audiotap.dll (Windows)
   libaudiotap.so (Unix)
In order to achieve that:
1. One solution is to deploy audiotap.h in the compiler's environment
   (e.g. /usr/include). Alternatively, the modifier AUDIOTAP_HDR can be used,
   with the path where audiotap.h is (not including audiotap.h). Example:
   >make cmdline/wav2prg AUDIOTAP_HDR=path/to/audiotap.h/
2. One solution is to deploy audiotap.lib or libaudiotap.so in the
   library path (e.g. /usr/lib). Alternatively, the modifier AUDIOTAP_LIB can
   be used, with the path where audiotap.lib or libaudiotap.so is.
   Example:
   >make cmdline/wav2prg AUDIOTAP_HDR=path/to/audiotap.h/ AUDIOTAP_LIB=/path/to/libaudiotap/
3. On Windows, just make sure audiotap.dll is in the same folder as the
   executable. On Unix, one solution is to deploy libaudiotap.so in the
   library path (e.g. /usr/lib). Alternatively, the modifier USE_RPATH can be
   used along with AUDIOTAP_LIB. If USE_RPATH is set to 1, the path to the
   library will be hard-coded in the executable's library search path. In this
   case it is recommended to specify an absolute path in AUDIOTAP_LIB.
   Example:
   >make cmdline/wav2prg AUDIOTAP_HDR=path/to/audiotap.h/ AUDIOTAP_LIB=/path/to/libaudiotap/ USE_RPATH=1

Other modifiers are:
* DEBUG: set to 1 to produce an executable that can be debugged with gdb. Example:
  >make wavprg.exe DEBUG=1
* CC: changes the compiler. Examples:
  >make CC=gcc
   needed if your installation does not provide cc.
  >make CC=clang
   if you want to use LLVM instead of gcc (and LLVM is installed).
  >make CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc
   if you are running Linux and you want to produce Windows DLLs (and you have
   the MinGW cross-compiler installed)
* WINDRES: changes the Windows resource compiler. Only needed when building
  the Windows GUI version and the Windows resource compiler has a non-standard
  name . Example:
  >make CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc WINDRES=i586-mingw32msvc-windres
* HTMLHELP: adds support for invoking help by pressing F1 in the Windows GUI
  version. Requires Microsoft HTML Help Workshop
  (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138) to be
  installed. Argument to HTMLHELP is HTML Help Workshop's installation path.
  Example:
  >make AUDIOTAP_HDR=..\libaudiotap AUDIOTAP_LIB=..\libaudiotap DEBUG=1 HTMLHELP="c:\Programmi\HTML Help Workshop"
