Includes for the Ti-83 and the TI-83 Plus (main.h ti83.h ti83p.h)
-----------------------------------------

Just a quick readme to explain things. The files included
have been changed to compile with z80asm, a linux z80 compiler
included with the project z88dk which can be found at sourceforge.
The main.h file assumes that your .asm files are in src/ and the includes in 
lib/ also, you'll have to define Plus either with the line:
Define		Plus
or the option -DPlus on the command line.
Thats all, if you need to convert anything else, either learn how to use
regexps (man 7 regex) or contact me
