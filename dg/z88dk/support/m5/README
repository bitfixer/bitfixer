SORD M5 support by Stefano Bodrato
This is been tested under the "SORD" emulator by Joseba Epalza.
To upload something on the emulator use the "inject utility" from the /support/generic folder:
So:

- run the emulator
- press F3 to save a clean RAM image
- exit from emulator (ESC)
- rename dump.ram to dump.img
- compile a program  (zcc +m5 hello.c)
- "inject" the program into the RAM dump (inject a.bin dump.img 1024 dump.ram)
- run the emulator
- press F4 to load the modified RAM dump
- type "call 29696" and enjoy !
