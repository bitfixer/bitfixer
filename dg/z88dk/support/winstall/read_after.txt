Important matters:

1.
You have to add the "bin" folder (under the installation directory) to your PATH environment variable, to access compiler commands directly from the command prompt.
2.
If you are running Windows ME, restart your computer after this setup procedure.
3.
do not delete the two files "unins000.exe" and "unins000.dat" under the installation directory: they are part of the uninstall process!
4.
the uninstall process will not delete the files and the directories that you add under the installation folder; hence please remove them by yourself.
