Z88DK Sprite Editor
-------------------
By Daniel McKinnon

- slightly upgraded by Stefano Bodrato -


This is a simple sprite editor for z88dk with it's main feature being that it
automatically will generate code for you.

This program is a little dodgy, and could use some work.  That's why you can send
me YOUR OWN updates!  stikmansoftware@yahoo.com
Anything welcome


Compiling:
Make sure you have Allegro (obtainable at http://www.allegro.cc/) a C compiler, and
an Operating System (which includes the Virus known as Wingblowz! :)


Unix: type "gcc -o sprite sprite.c `allegro-config --libs` "
Those are ticks " ' " (above the ~ key on most keyboards) not apostraphies " ' "

DJGPP: type "gcc -o sprite.exe sprite.c -lalleg "

Visual C: from the Visual Studio command prompt type "cl sprite.c alleg.lib"
