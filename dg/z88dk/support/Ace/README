The Jupiter ACE has a built-in FORTH interpreter in ROM (no BASIC, here!)
There is very little software for it;  maybe the Z88DK will help !

FORTH command syntax:
s l bsave <name> saves l bytes from the memory starting at address s as <name> 
s l bload <name> loades l bytes to the memory starting at address s as <name>. If s or l is zero will their value be taken from the file. 
addr call will call Z80 machine code at addr, should be terminated with a jp (iy) Z80 instruction. 


So (HOWTO for the "VACE" emulator):

- compile the program:				zcc +ace program.c
- convert it:					bin2byt a.bin program.byt
- run the emulator				vace
- from within the emulator, load the program:	16384 40000 bload program
- run the thing:				16384 call


Have fun !

Using ACE32 on WinNT/Win2000

Get the file:
http://users.aol.com/autismuk/ace/ace32.zip

It is compiled with an old DOS extender and gives compatibility problems when used on WinNT.
To override this, get the updated extender from:
http://michael.tippach.bei.t-online.de/wdosx/

Download the latest release and unzip the binary folder.
Then update the ACE32 DOS extender stub with the "stubtit" utility:
stubit ace32.exe

It will replace the faulty stub with a working one.


Then (HOWTO for the "ACE32" emulator):

- compile the program:				zcc +ace program.c
- delete the old TAP file			del prog.tap
- convert it:					acetap a.bin prog.tap
- run the emulator				ace32 prog.tap
- from within the emulator, load the program:	16384 40000 bload
- run the thing:				16384 call


Have fun !
