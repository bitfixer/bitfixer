As we all know Bogomips are dodgy..very dodgy infact!

Here's a z80 version with two switches, compile either:

% zcc -DPORTABLE_BOGOMIPS bogomips.c -o bogomips.bas
% zcc -DZ80_DELAY bogomips.c -o bogomips.bas

The first uses C to generate the delay loop, the second uses
some asm which achieves the same..with a speedup of about
8 fold. Here's eome figures:

-DPORTABLE_BOGOMIPS

ZX Spectrum (emulated via ZXAM) - 0.0148 Bogomips (7400 loops)
Z88 (Real thing)		- 0.0134 Bogomips (6700)
(Flicking installer options achieves the same result)

-DZ80_DELAY

ZX Spectrum (emulated via ZXAM) - 0.10   Bogomips (51200)
Z88 (Real thing/Int/OZ+)	- 0.0910 Bogomips (45500)
Z88 (Real thing/OZ+)		- 0.0916 Bogomips (45800)
Z88 (Real thing/Int)		- 0.0916 Bogomips (45800)
Z88 (Real thing)		- 0.0928 Bogomips (46400)

Ironic thing is that you can't really compare the two machines since
clock() on the ZX just picks up some values where as on the z88 it uses
the OS. However, the delay loop does take longer than these functions do
take so I think it's probably possible to compare.

Taking -Z80_DELAY:

(.10 / 0.928 ) * 3.28 = 3.53

Where 3.28 is the ~ clockspeed of the z88 and 3.53 is ~ clockspeed of ZX -
so we have rough concurrence

Tired of rebooting your system so you can see how many BogoMIPS it's
running at today?  Want to impress your friends?  Be the first person
on your block to run the standalone bogomips program.  Now you can
measure BogoMIPs all day long without having to bring your system
down.  This could be the "killer app" that Linux has been waiting for.

"Bogomips" is a standalone program that displays your system
performance using one of the world's most recognized benchmarks.  It
uses the same code that is used in the Linux kernel while booting, but
runs as a user program.

A man page and make file are included. Detailed instructions for
building, running, and installing are in the file INSTALLNG.

Version 1.3 of BogoMIPs is now portable and should run on any system
that supports an ANSI C compiler and library.

The package is available from sunsite.unc.edu in the directory
/pub/Linux/system/Misc

P.S. Don't forget to post your results to the net and impress
thousands of people around the world!
