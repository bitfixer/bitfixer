There are three variants of this program:

- portable version (only requires ANSI C compiler and library)
- original Linux version (dependent on gcc and Intel CPU)
- QNX version (dependent on QNX C compiler and Intel CPU)

The first two versions should give the same results if you are using
gcc under Linux. The original Linux version also works under FreeBSD
and BSD386. The portable version is the default. Edit the appropriate
lines in the make file to select one of the others.

To build for Linux under gcc, just type "make". If using a compiler
other than GNU gcc, edit the compile options in the makefile.

Run the program as "bogomips".

Install the binary and man page using "make install" as root (change
the makefile if you don't want them put in /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/man).
