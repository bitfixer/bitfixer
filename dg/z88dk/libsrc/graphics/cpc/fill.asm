;      Action: Fills an area of the  screen  starting from the current
;              graphics position and extending until it reaches either
;              the edge of the window or a pixel set to the PEN
;      Entry:  A holds a PEN to fill with, HL holds the address of the
;              buffer, and DE holds the length of the buffer
;      Exit:   If the area was filled properly, then Carry is true; if
;              the area was not filled, then Carry is false; in either
;              case, A, BC, DE, HL  and  the  other flags are corrupt,
;              and all others are preserved
;      Notes:  The buffer is  used  to  store  complex  areas to fill,
;              which are remembered and  filled  when  the basic shape
;              has been done;  each  entry  in  the  buffer uses seven
;              bytes and so the more complex  the shape the larger the
;              buffer; if it runs out of  space to store these complex
;              areas, it will fill what  it  can  and then return with
;              Carry false
