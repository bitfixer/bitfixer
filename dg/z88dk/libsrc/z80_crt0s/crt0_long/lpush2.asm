;       This routine is used to push longs on the stack for a 
;       call to a function defined as a pointer. To make the
;       routine shorter (by one byte) we could use ix - pop ix/jp(ix)
;       but we'd lose 6T - give me your thoughts as to whether it's
;       worth it...

; actually use of ix saves us 4T
