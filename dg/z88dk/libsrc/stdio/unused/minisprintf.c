/*
 * Minix source: src/commands/simple/uud.c

 * Printf style formatting. (Borrowed from MicroEmacs by Dave Conroy.) 
 * A lot smaller than the full fledged printf.
 *
 * Liberated once more and inserted into Small C+ 29/4/99 djm
 *
 * This routine is quite long also, hopefully it'll become a lot
 * shorter with the new io routines
 *
 * New I/O version, we fake up a file channel which is in fact
 * a string djm 1/4/2000
