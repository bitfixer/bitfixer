The stdio library needs a couple of machine specific routines

These are all located in {machine}/ directory below this
one. ie z88/ for the z88 routines

Also in the {machine}/ directory are other stdio routines which
are non-portable eg rename/remove

fputc_cons	- Write a character to the console
fgetc_cons	- Get a character from the console
fgets_cons	- Read a string from console
fabandon	- Abandon file (can be null fn - z88's is really)

fdtell		- Get file position for filehandle fd (ret long)
fdgetpos	- Get file position into mem (ptr supplied)

Other routines needed from fcntl.h

open_z88
close
readbyte
writebyte
read
write
lseek

The _z88 routines allow the return of the explicit filename for the
opened file. If you're porting then it might be a nice idea to
support this concept across machines.
