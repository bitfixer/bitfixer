       ccaalllloocc(()) allocates memory for an array of  _n_m_e_m_b  elements
       of  _s_i_z_e bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated
       memory.  The memory is set to zero.

       mmaalllloocc(()) allocates _s_i_z_e bytes and returns a pointer to the
       allocated memory.  The memory is not cleared.

       ffrreeee(())  frees  the  memory  space pointed to by _p_t_r, which
       must have been returned by a previous call to mmaalllloocc(())  or
       ccaalllloocc(())  Otherwise,  or  if  ffrreeee((_p_t_r))  has  already been
       called before, undefined  behaviour  occurs.   If  _p_t_r  is
       NNUULLLL, no operation is performed.

       For ccaalllloocc(()) and mmaalllloocc(()), the value returned is a pointer
       to the allocated memory, which is suitably aligned for any
       kind of variable, or NNUULLLL if the request fails.

       ffrreeee(()) returns no value.

NNOOTTEESS
       These functions manipulate memory in a private memory page
       belonging to ZSock. This 16k page holds  all  the  buffers
       that  ZSock  uses  and hence requests for large amounts of
       memory are likely to fail (and in any case are not  recom-
       mended).

       This  facility  has  been  offered  to allow daemons to be
       written easily (they have no address space of their  own).
       User  applications  should  not use these facilities. If a
       large (>256 bytes) amount of memory is required for a user
       application  then  the application should either be of the
       BAD type or be redesigned.
