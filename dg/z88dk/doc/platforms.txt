(1) The Xircom REX 6000 port provides hooks into the native OS. No z88dk i/o functions are supported
(2) Flagged for a lot of time as "instable" because of an emulator instability !!
(3) Much of the "OZDK" functions are ported; at the moment doesn't work if code size > 8Kbytes.
(4) Sprinter has many "standard" functions implemented
(5) Work on a +3 (and others) file library is in progress

FP Unstable = On these platforms there are problems using some of the "special" registers, making some functions crash.
The float variables, for example, can't be used (for now).
