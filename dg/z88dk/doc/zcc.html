<H2><A NAME="new"></A>What's New?</A></H2>

<P>Please See the file readme.1st in the root directory of the
archive for more information</P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</A></H2>

<P>The z88 Development Kit (hereafter known as z88dk) is an advanced set of
tools allowing the production of complex programs for z80 based computers 
in either C or assembly language.</P>

<P>Although titled <I>z88</I>dk this a little bit misleading; as supplied
the kit produces code for over a dozen z80 based machines and can be easily
retargetted to any z80 based machine with the minimum of effort (see the file 
<A HREF="retarget.txt">retarget.txt</A> for details on how to do this.)

<P>z88dk consists of the Z80 Module Assembler (z80asm) from Interlogic, a
highly extended Small C+ compiler as well as various libraries implementing
a large subset of the ANSI standard.</P>

<B>Code Output</B>

<P>For the z88 the kit produces the following executables:</P>

<LI>
  <UL> Programs runnable from BBC BASIC
  <UL> Absolute address runable programs
  <UL> Relocatable programs
  <UL> Good, bad, ugly applications and popdowns
  <UL> Packages (aka shared libraries)
</LI>

<P>For the spectrum only absolute address executables are produced</P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="status"></A>Status</H2>

<P>Well, the package has finally been released, and we're now up to the
umpteenth release, the status of it quite tricky, the source for all of it
is released and anyone can port it to anything they feel like, however
if any changes are made to the compiler, frontend, appmaker, optimizer,
libraries, includes could you please let me know so that I we keep this
kit unified. Any changes to z80asm should be reported to <A HREF="mailto:gbs@image.dk">Gunther</A> (see z80asm.txt file).

<P>The Kit is free to use for free applications (though let me know if
you do use it!), if you create a commercial product then I (and I'm sure
Gunther) would be most appreciative of a copy.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="acknowledge"></A>Acknowledgements</H2>

<P>Thanks to everyone who submitted bug reports, extends and uses z88dk</P>

<P>The Z88 Development Kit was, and always will be, "Made with <A
HREF="http://www.amiga.com">Amiga</A>." Though a Linux box or two
did help along the way!</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="install"></A>Installation</H2>

<H4>*nix Installation</H4>

<P>Move the tgz file to your home area and extract it using the
command:</P>

<PRE>% tar xvzf [filename]</PRE>

<P>Once this has been done you'll find a new directory called z88dk and
under that you'll find the following directory tree:</P>

<PRE>
        
        bin/        Executable directory
        doc/        Place for doc files
        examples/   A few example programs (for z88 and Spectrum)
        include/    Header files for the C compiler
        lib/        Where the runtime libraries and startup code live
        libsrc/     Source for the runtime libraries
        src/      
        src/appmake Source for the application maker
        src/z80asm  Source for the z80asm Module Assembler
        src/copt    Source for the z80 code optimiser
        src/cpp     Source for the DECUS cpp
        src/sccz80  Source for the C compiler
        src/zcc     Source for the front end
	support/    Miscellaneous code snippets</PRE>

<P>In order to use z88dk you'll need to first of all build the binaries,
to this go into the z88dk directory and enter:</P>

<PRE>% make</PRE>

<P>And with a bit of luck things will be built for you! Next you'll need to add the z88dk/bin directory into your path, this
is done easily under tcsh by editing your .cshrc (or .tcshrc) and inserting
the line:</P>

<PRE>setenv $PATH $HOME/z88dk/bin\:$PATH</PRE>

<P>Whilst you're there add the lines:</P>

<PRE>setenv ZCCCFG $HOME/z88dk/lib/config/
setenv Z80_OZFILES $HOME/z88dk/lib
setenv Z80_STDLIB $HOME/z88dk/lib/clibs/s.lib</PRE>

<P>If you use a different shell, eg bash or some other hideous contrivance
you'll have to use a different method (consult a convenient
manual/guru)</P>


<P>Log in a new shell, type zcc, and with a bit of luck you'll see a
short message - congratulations you've now installed z88dk and can
start programming!</P>

<H4>Amiga Installation</H4>

<P>Extract the archive to any directory you feel like, and add the
following lines to your s:user-startup file:</P>

<PRE>;BEGIN Z88DK
cd [directory where you installed it]/bin
execute startzcc
;ENDF Z88DK</PRE>

<P>MSDOS/Win32 Installation</H4>

<P>Grab the executables from Dennis' homepage?</P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="frontend"></A>The Frontend</A></H2>

<P>The frontend of z88dk is called zcc, it is this that you should call
if you want to do any compilations. To invoke the frontend use the
command:</P>

<PRE>
        zcc [flags]  [files to be compiled/linked]</PRE>

<P>The files can be either C files (.c) , preprocessed C files(.i),
compiled C files (.asm), optimised compiled file (.opt) or assembled files
(.obj), any combination of them can be mixed together and the relevant
processed done on them.</P>

<P>Processing of a file list is done on each file in turn (i.e. preprocess,
compile, optimise, assemble) at the end all files may be linked into a
single executable if desired.</P>

<P>Options to control the action of the frontend:</P>

<PRE>
     +[file]       Name of alternate <A HREF="#config">config</A> file 
     		   (must be the first argument)
     -a            Produce .asm (or .opt) file only
     -c            Do not link object files
     -E            Preprocess files only, leave output in .i file
     -o [file]     Specify output file for binary (default is a.bas for BASIC
                   programs and a.bin for application binaries)
     -On           <A HREF="#copt">Optimize</A> compiler output (to .opt file)
                   n can be either 0 (none) 1,2,3, level 2 is recommended.
		   Level 3 is suitable for large programs (includes certain
		   lib functions to reduce size of code(!))
     -v            Verbose - echo commands as they are executed
     -vn           Don't be verbose
</PRE>

<P>Options to control library usage:</P>

<PRE>
     -l[name]      Link in a library - supply just the name (after placing them
                   in the correct directory)
     -lm           Link in the generic Z80 maths library
     -lmz          Link in and generate code for OZ's maths routines
     -lmalloc      Link in the near malloc routines
     -lgfx         Link in the graphics routines (for BASIC progams)
     -lgfxapp      Link in the graphics routines (for applications)
     -lz88         Link in some Z88 application routines (eg mailboxing)
     -lnet	   Link the the socket routines for ZSock
     -m            Generate .map files when assembling/linking
</PRE>

<P>Options to control the type code produced:</P>

<PRE>
     -unsigned     Implicitly define everything as unsigned unless explicitly
                   told otherwise.
     -create-app   Create an application image (i.e. bank 63,62 etc)
     -make-app     (App) Notify the compiler that you're trying to make an
                   application
     -reqpag=      (App) Number of 256 byte pages required for bad
                   application
     -zorg=        (App) Origin for a Z88 application
     -safedata=    (App) Amount of safedata required by your code
     -defvars=     (App) Where static variables should be dropped (only
                   valid for single file compilations, but see <A HREF="#printf">later</A>)
     -expandz88    (App) Expanded z88 required
     -no-expandz88 (App) Expanded z88 not required (these two flags toggle
                   some startup code to check for an expanded machine)

     -startup=3    Produce standalone code that can be run from a set
                   address from BASIC. Use -zorg= to change the address
     -R            (Use with above) produces relocatable code that can be
                   loaded into a DIM'd BASIC array.

     -smartpf      Intelligent <A HREF="#printf">printf</A> routine handling
     -no-smartpf   Turn off the intelligent printf handling
     -make-lib     Shortcut to generate .o files from library .c files
     -stackoffset  Sets the stack offset for shared libs (see package.txt
		   for details)
                   
</PRE>

<P>Miscellaneous options:</P>

<PRE>
     -z80-verb     Allow z80asm to be verbose, this tends to generate a lot
                   of output to the screen so may not be desired.
     -cc           Intersperse C code as comments in the assembler output, warning:
                   this *will* clobber some optimizations.
     -Wall         Turn on all the compiler warnings
     -Wnone        Turn off all compiler warnings
     -Wn[num]      Turn off the compiler warning [num]
     -W[num]       Turn on the compiler warning [num]
     -asxx	   Cause the compiler to emit asxx compatible code
     -Cp[option]   Pass an option through to the pre-processor
     -Ca[option]   Pass an option through to the assembler
</PRE>

<P>In addition, the flags, -D, -I, -U are passed through to the preprocessor.</P>

<P>Any unrecognised options are passed through to the compiler (to allow
for improvements in the future.)</P>

<P><A NAME="config"></A>Configuration files</P>

<P>In order for z88dk to work on as many platforms as possible and so
that it can be easily tweaked, retargetted and generally mutilated, the
frontend (zcc) consults a plain text configuration file which is in the
directory pointed to be the ZCCCFG variable.</P>

<P>The default is to use the file ZCCCFG/zcc.cfg which by default is a softlink to the configuration file for
the z88. Should you mainly be targetting a different machine then simply 
change the softlink to the appropriate file.</P>

<P>Should you want to occasionally compile for other machines then as
the construct your zcc line thusly:</P>

<PRE>zcc +[name] [....]</PRE>

<P>Where name is either z88, zx (Spectrum), or vz (for the VZ200/300 port).
If you wish to use a config file located in the current directory or anywhere
else on the system then specify the full path and filename - make sure the
filename as the suffix .cfg.</P>

<P>Finally, for the sake of backwards compatibility zcc will take the value
of the environmental variable ZCCFILE and use that config file.</P>

<P>The order of checking is as follows:</P>

<OL>
	<LI> "Local" file (if exists) eg +temp.cfg
	<LI> ZCCCFG/[name].cfg eg +z88
	<LI> ZCCFILE
	<LI> ZCCCFG/zcc.cfg
</OL>

</UL>


<H3><A NAME="compintro"></A>Introduction to the Compiler</H3>


<P>
The Compiler is based upon the Small C/Plus compiler which has long history
but can be basically be attributed to in chronological order: Cain, Van
Zandt, Hendrix and Ronald Yorston. This last person in particular developed
the compiler very considerably beyond the original specification for Small
C set down by Ron Cain. James R. Van Zandt modified it to include floating
point using floating routines originally written by Neil Colvin.</P>

<P>I too have further extended the compiler and hopefully made it into a
true cross compiler which can produce z80 code from any machine.</P>

<P>The compiler accepts a subset of Standard C, for more details about C
see the ubiquitous K&R - "The C Programming Language", if you want details
about the compiler try and find the now out of print "The Small-C Handbook"
by James E Hendrix. Information on the original incarnation of the
compiler is available from <A HREF="http://www.ddj.com">Dr Dobbs</A> CDROM, though at $50 it could be considered overpriced.</P>

<H3><A NAME="compdatat"></A>Datatypes Supported by the Compiler</H3>

<P>Small C+ supports a wide variety of datatypes which are similar to those
in ANSI C, however it should be noted that the <I>float</I> type is a
synonym for <I>double</I> - unlike big C there are not two different
types.</P>

<P>Characters, ints and longs may be either signed or unsigned. Their
maximum and minimum values are detailed in the table below.  Pointers
contain the addresses of data elements and are treated as unsigned ints
when compared. NB. The size of pointers is likely to be userdefinable in
the future:</P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR><TD><B>Type</B></TD>
<TD><B>Size</B></TD>
<TD><B>Min</B></TD>
<TD><B>Max</B></TD></TR>
 
 
<TR><TD>char</TD><TD>1 byte</TD><TD>-128</TD><TD>127</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>unsigned char</TD><TD>1 byte</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>255</TD></TR>
 
<TR><TD>int</TD><TD>2 bytes</TD><TD>-32767</TD><TD>32767</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>unsigned int</TD><TD>1 bytes</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>65535</TD></TR>
 
<TR><TD>long</TD><TD>4 bytes</TD><TD>-2147483647</TD><TD>2147483647</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>unsigned long</TD><TD>4 bytes</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>4294967296</TD></TR>
 
</TABLE></CENTER>
 
<P>The compiler supports a wide range of data types up to pointers to
pointers to type.</P>

<P>Hopefully longs will now be correctly handled - including all arithmetic
routines. One area which I haven't addressed is the conversion to and
from doubles - they might work if they are smaller than 32767/65535 (signed/unsigned) for the generic routines. If the z88 maths routines are used any conversion should work perfectly fine.</P>

<P>Structures are declared in the usual way but may not contain instances
of themselves, but may contain pointers to instances of themselves. Passing
structures to a function is not permitted i.e. the only legal way a
structure can occur in a function argument is as a pointer.</P>

<P><A HREF="far.html">Far</A> pointers are now supported, although library
code only exists for the z88.</P>

<H2><A NAME="compcode"></A>Writing Code</H2>

<P>In this section I'll just raise a few of the more obscure aspects of the
compiler</P>

<P>Rather a lot of optimization rules have been written for the unsigned
char type. So use them as much as possible, particularly if you wish
to use logical operations (&|^). Doubles are particularly unwieldy and
the code which accesses them cannot be optimized particularly well, so
avoid them if at all possible (not suprisingly they aren't the speediest of
types either).</P>

<P>Other tips include define arrays and chars first of all in a function and 
ints later. Loop counting ints which are defined last of all will (when the code is optimized) generate much faster and smaller code.</P>

<P>If you do define a global (static) variable (as opposed to just declaring 
its presence) please note that the variable is embedded within the code and could not be changed if the program were to be blown onto an EPROM. Also 
important to note is that global doubles can not be initialised.</P>

<P>It is possible to mix C and assembly in a single source file, simply 
enclose the assembler language with #asm/#endasm or with #pragma
asm/#pragma endasm. It isn't advisted that you mix assembler and C unless
you know very well what you're doing!</P>

<P>Having said that, possibly the most useful use of the #asm/#endasm would be to initialize 
global variables (though this can be done automatically), this could be used to easily define udg graphics for example:</P>

<PRE>
extern char udg[8];

main()
{
/* Put some code here! */
}

#asm
; A very boring graphic! 
._udg    defb 185,170,185,170,185,170,185,170
#endasm</PRE>

<P>Note the use of the _ prefix - this has been added to avoid label
clashes with the library.</P>


<H2><A NAME="macros">Macros</H2>

<P>There is another method to call machine code from within C - the
"asm function" this is an incredibly useful way of getting macros into
z80asm, an example of how to do it is in the example/ directory, it's
easier to read the example than to read me try to describe it(!)</P>

<P>As well as providing macros, asm() can be used to call machine code
routines embedded with C expressions (caution!!). An example of using it
this way follows:</P>

<PRE>
main()
{
        int j;
        j=asm("call\tfish");
}

#asm
.fish
        ld      hl,1
        ret
#endasm</PRE>

<P>Not perhaps the best example ever, but it illustrates its use - you can
also return longs (kept in dehl) and chars (in h=0,l)</P>

<P>There is another feature of this version of Small C which could potentially 
be of much use if you were combining an existing assembler and a C program. 
This is the so called external pointer data type, and I shall illustrate it's 
use with a few C examples and the hypothetical assembler code produced, let 
us assume that hl is the integer j.</P>

<PRE>
extern int data(address);       address=16 bit Z80 address

function()
{
        int j;
        j=data          ld  hl,(address)
        j=&data         ld  hl,address
}</PRE>

<P>You can similarly do the same trick with chars and doubles. I believe 
this to be slightly "non-standard" but could prove invaluable for finding out system variables etc.</P>

<H2><A NAME="limit"></A>Compiler Limitations</H2>

<P>It's important to remember that the compiler isn't gcc! It's still
the Small C+ compiler, albeit with a lot of extensions, to this
end remember the following:

<UL>
        <LI> **** Pointers to functions cannot be prototyped!! ****
        <LI> enums are treated as constants - there's no checking that
you are assigning an appropriate value to an enum type (which is just an int)
        <LI> typedef doesn't consider pointers - I hope to change this in future
        <LI> casts may be a bit dodgy on pointers to pointers (my brain
tends to turn to putty around about this point)
        <LI> Although there's no warning about it, the compiler knows
that you're being naughty when converting between pointer types without
a cast (a result of my brain being putty around pointer to pointers!)
        <LI> Multidimensional arrays are not supported (see above)
        <LI> Bitfields are not supported, the compiler parses them, but
warns you that they're not supported - you never know code may actually work!!
        <LI> The compiler evaluates expressions left to right eg (1 + j + 3) will create bulkier code than ( j + 1 + 3 )
        <LI> Remember to specify types with constants - in certain cases
the compiler may not do the necessary conversion from short to long
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="printf"></A>Printf Functions</A></H2>

<P>I'll be honest, printf() is a beast, the integer version with formatting
control ways in at over 2k which is a little large to say the least, so
with a little bit of scraping around I present you with miniprintf! This
function is a substitute for printf() with the following limitations:</P>

<UL>
<LI> Only %s, %d, %c %% %u %ld %lu types are accepted
<LI> No width formatting control
<LI> It doesn't return the number of characters printed
</UL>

<P>If possible the compiler will scan your format string and if it sees just these types then it will use miniprintf() instead, however should
you require the number of characters printed then we're in trouble! To
disable this "intelligent" substitution specify the command flag
-no-smartpf, it is enabled by default.</P>

<P>However miniprintf() is faster so perhaps on occasion (and with
flagrant regard to memory requirements) you want to switch between them,
you're a bit stuck if you can only specify flags on the command line, which
is where the universal #pragma directive comes into play once more.</P>

<P>If in your source file you insert the line:</P>

<PRE>#pragma -no-smartpf</PRE>

<P>You'll turn off intelligent printf handling, but if you want it back
again, just insert a:</P>

<PRE>#pragma -smartpf</PRE>

<P>And it'll be turned back on again, of course this #pragma has other
uses, for example in compiling applications, the command line to compile
them is, to be frank, a bit of a gobful at times, so simply stick these
lines at the top of your source file(s):</P>

<PRE>#pragma -make-app
#pragma -reqpag=0
#pragma -no-expandz88</PRE>

<P>Or whatever is appropriate for your application, all sccz80 specific
flags can be specified within the source file, with the exception of
-make-lib which <B>has</B> to be on the command line. So if you
are using safedata space for static variables you can specify the
DEFVARS address for each module. NB. I will not be responsible for
tears and other distress that this may cause, if you use -safedata= or
-defvars= then it is assumed you know what you're doing!!!</P>



<HR>
<H2><A NAME="copt"></A>z80 Code Optimizer</A></H2>

<P>The optimizer supplied with the package is of the peephole variety -
i.e. if it spots a a group of lines which it knows can be better
represented in another way it will - it isn't (and never will) be a
true optimizer and keep track of register usage and avoid repeated loading
of a register with the same value.</P>

<P>Hopefully the rules supplied will not cause any software to fail (I
haven't come across anything yet - and I have used them a lot), however
if they do, then just <A HREF="mailto:djm@jb.man.ac.uk">mail</A> me with
the C source and the assembler output (raw and optimized) and I'll see
what I can do to remedy the situation.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="linker"></A>Assembler and Linker</A></H2>

<P>As previously noted the assembler and linker are combined in the z80asm Module Assembler from Interlogic. Using this program has numerous
advantages over the traditional method of using a separate linker and
assembler, briefly these are:
</P>

<UL>
        <LI> Compact object file format (no more bulky Intel Hex object files)
        <LI> Fast, small and cross-compilable
        <LI> Extensive built in support for the Z88..
        <LI> ..whilst not sacrificing generic z80 compatibility
        <LI> A good general purpose assembler for assembly projects
        <LI> Most of the Z88 community is familar with the syntax
        <LI> Still being actively developed.

</UL>

<P>I will always support (where applicable) any new features in z80asm,
for example in v1.2 of the kit the following new z80asm features are
used:</P>

<UL>
        <LI> Ability to specify an output file
        <LI> Ability to define scope of variables labels anywhere within a .asm file (goodbye .hdr!!)
        <LI> Errors now give the module name in which they occurred
        <LI> Text is now defined in .asm files via defm (OK, it's not a new
feature in z80asm, but it's new for sccz80!) - this can result in a
decrease in assembly time.
</UL>

<P>In future z80asm is due to gain sections, these will of course be used
by z88dk allowing more library routines to be used in z88 applications.</P>

<H2><A NAME="libraries"></A>Libraries and Includes</H2>

<P>I have endeavoured to put together a fairly comprehensive library of 
functions which cover most of the things that smallish C programs would want to do. There are of course many omissions and undoubtedly many
mistakes, so if you find one, could you either endeavour to fix it and send
me the corrected version or alternatively let me know and I'll find the
time to repair it.</P>

<B>malloc.h</B></P>

<PRE>
extern void *calloc(int number, int size_of_datatype);
extern void *malloc(int bytes);
extern free(char *);
extern getfree(void);
extern getlarge(void);
extern initmem(int size);

</PRE>
I've kludged around and come up with an extremely rudimentary malloc/free
scheme for Small C. All memory is allocated out of character array! The
routines actually come from a file I spotted on an MSX website a year or
so ago, here's an example of how to use these routines.</P>

<PRE>

#include &lt;malloc.h>

/*
 * Define the size of the pool, HEAPSIZE is a macro for unsigned char [ ]
 */
#define HPSIZE 8192
HEAPSIZE(HPSIZE)


main()
{
        char *s;
        int size;
        initmem(HPSIZE);        /* Initialise the heap - has to be done! */
        s=malloc(100);
        if (s == 0 ) exit(0);
        free(s);
        size=getfree();         /* Get total free memory */
        size=getlarge();        /* Get size of largest block */
}
</PRE>

<P>Don't forget to link with -lmalloc</P>

<H2><A NAME="examples"></A>Example Programs</H2>

<P>Included within the package are a few C example programs, they're quite 
simple, but prove that the package does actually work!</P>

<P>There is also a number of demo applications hidden within the
examples/apps directory, these are supplied in a format suitable for
installing using the RAM Installer. I'll briefly describe them:</P>

<P><B>dstar</B> A short puzzle game written almost entirely in C, it's
quite a tricky one I warn you now!</P>

<P><B>rpn</B> The application version of the Reverse Polish Notation
calculator.</P>

<P><B>useless</B> Completely useless, just a short demo of how to
interact with OZ using C - demonstrates menus, help and commands</P>

<P><B>viewer</B> A simple popup (about 20 lines of code), displays the
contents of a file on to the screen (select a file from the Filer)</P>

<P><B>wc</B> Another simple pop up which displays the number of bytes
words and lines in a file (select a file fomr the filer)</P>

<H2><A NAME="spectrum"></A>Spectrum Support</H2>

<P>I've started some (minimal) ZX Spectrum support, it's not perfect,
but it's just enough to run a couple of example programs. I've implemented
simple functions such as getk(),getkey() (non-standard) and putchar(),
puts(),gets(),putc(). The miniprintf routines should also work.
These few routines make it 
possible to run enigma.c
successfully. I've also played around with dstar.c (just minor changes
to the graphics routines) and it too now works on the Spectrum; some
screenshots:</P>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="enigma.gif" ALT="Enigma ZX Screenshot"></TD>
<TD>A screenshot of the enigma.c program in action on the Spectrum. It's
not exactly exciting, but it was the first program to be compiled and
as you can see works pretty well perfectly!</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="dstar.gif" ALT="DstarZX Screensgit"></TD>
<TD>Another easy port from the Z88. This game has quite a complex history,
and finally it's made it onto the Spectrum. It's a fairly tricky puzzler,
so prepare for frustration!</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>In addition to the routines mentioned above, all ctype.h and strings.h
functions are available. In addition generic Z80 Maths support as well
as the near-malloc routines should work. All routines in stdlib.h with
the exception of sleep() and csleep() should also function as per the
z88 - have a look at the {zcc}/libsrc/speclist for details of what
is in the Spectrum library.</P>

<H2><A NAME="problems"></A>Known Feechures aka bugs!</H2>


<P>Hopefully this list will first grow(!) and then shrink as I sort them 
out.</P>

<P><B>28.1.2000</B></P>

<P><B>---</B>Casts can sometimes through a wobbly generating incorrect
code. I've tried to fix them but they may still occasionally go wrong.</P>

<P><B>8.3.99</B></P>

<P><B>---></B>The supplied preprocessor is ANSI C and doesn't strip //
style comments - solution don't use them or use the -// flag. The compiler
should strip // style comments however.</P>

<P>So, I guess you're here cos your code doesn't work? Have you checked it
- I mean have you really checked it? Does it make sense, there are no
wild pointers are there? Ah, where does it go wrong then? In a library
function? Good, delve into the libsrc directory pull out the relevant
file and look at it. Spotted a bug? Tell me about it and I'll put it right.</P>

<H2><A NAME="history"></A>Some Past History</A></H2>

<P>The development history of the Z88DK is now found in the separate file <A HREF="history.html">history.html</A>.</P>

<HR>


<H2><A NAME="future"></A>The Future</A></H2>

<P>Pretty well all the goals have been achieved! Now the fun with library
routines begins! I'm starting to rewrite all of the library functions
in C where far access is a possibility - i.e. string functions, stdio
etc. Garry has written some nice z88 far memory management routines so all
that's left are the bugs!</P>

<P>Future developments can of course be found on the z88dk
<A HREF="http://z88dk.sourceforge.net">website</A> where I will 
upload the latest distributions on a fairly regular basis.</P>
